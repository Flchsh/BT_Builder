# BT_Builder
Behaviour tree tool for Unity

This is my thesis project. BT Builder is an AI tool for designing and running Behavior Tree based behaviors. It includes:
  - Visual editor to construct behaviors (saved as xml)
  - Components that run the behaviors
  - Visual debugging to follow behavior execution in runtime

Users will have to write their own action and condition nodes (there's no node library, just the basic structure nodes to control execution). Currently the functionality relies on things being in specific folders inside the tool folder, which restricts project organizing. I'm aiming to improve this at some point, but I'm not making any promises.

BT Builder has been beta tested in several game projects at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.

Latest version was tested on Unity 5.5. Development is currently in limbo because of other stuff I'm doing, so I cannot guarantee that it will work with newest versions of Unity.
