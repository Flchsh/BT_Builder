\pard\plain \fi720\sl360\slmult1\qj\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The tree component has an Edit tree file -button, which opens the behavior editor. You can either open an existing behavior file, or make a new behavior from scratch. When the behavior is saved, it is also assigned to the tree component.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is also useful for quickly editing values that are set in the editor. NOTE: Values set in editor are treated like constants and saved in the tree file itself. Changing values from one gameobject will change those values for all objects that use the same file. If you want to use the same behavior structure for different gameobjects with different value settings, you have to use different save files, or set values through the Blackboard, which is unique for each BT_Behave component.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The behavior file is only used for creating and initialising the actual behavior instance, so editing the file during play mode has no effect. Edit Tree File -button is disabled during play mode.}}
